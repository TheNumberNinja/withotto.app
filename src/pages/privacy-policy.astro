                                personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or
                                unauthorised disclosure or access. We may use third-party products and services to
                                secure or store your information.</p>

                            <p class=" leading-[34px] mb-[15px]">Where you have chosen a password, which enables you to
                                access the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You

                            <p class=" leading-[34px] mb-[15px]">Unfortunately, the transmission of information via
                                internet is not completely secure. Although we will work hard to protect your personal
                                information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to the
                                Service; use of the Service is at your own risk.</p>

                            <p class=" leading-[34px] mb-[15px]">We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected

                            <p class=" leading-[34px] mb-[15px]">When deciding what the correct time is to keep the data
                                for we look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm from
                                unauthorised use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved by
                                other means and legal requirements.</p>

                            <p class=" leading-[34px] mb-[15px]">Under data protection laws you have rights in relation
                                to your personal data that include the right to request access, correction, erasure,
                                restriction, transfer, to object to processing, to portability of data and (where the
                                lawful ground of processing is consent) to withdraw consent.</p>

                            <p class=" leading-[34px] mb-[15px]">You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal
                                data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee
                                if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive or refuse to comply with
                                your request in these circumstances.</p>

                            <p class=" leading-[34px] mb-[15px]">We may need to request specific information from you to
                                help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
                                exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal
                                data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact
                                you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our
                                response.</p>

                                month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly
                                complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you.</p>
