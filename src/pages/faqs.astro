                                        SmartMatch?</h3>
                                    <p class="pb-2">SmartMatch is our secret sauce. Rather than trying to work out
                                        whether a payment on the bank statement relates to an invoice or bill in Xero
                                        based on the payee and reference details, SmartMatch looks at one year of
                                        previous reconciliation data for each of your clients to learn how you have
                                        reconciled in the past.</p>
                                    <p class="pb-2">With that data, Otto can find patterns in those past reconciliations
                                        to reduce
                                        mistakes and reconcile some trickier matches than other bookkeeping bots.</p>
                                    <p class="pb-2">For each green match on the bank reconciliation page, Otto will use
                                        this training
                                        data to decide whether it's a match or non-match, and a confidence level from 0
                                        to 100%. For example, he could be 90% sure something is not a match, or 50% sure
                                        something is a match. By default, we require Otto to be at least 90% sure
                                        the match is correct before he will reconcile.</p>

                                        the pros and cons of SmartMatch?</h3>
                                    <p class="pb-2">Our primary goal with Otto is that he should not make an incorrect
                                        match. We
                                        don't want you to have to constantly check what he has done because you
                                        can't trust he's done the right thing. SmartMatch allows us to make sure Otto is
                                        really unlikely to do the wrong thing.</p>
                                    <p class="pb-2">Sometimes SmartMatch will mean Otto is not as confident about a
                                        match as you
                                        might expect. This is more likely if the information on the bank statement
                                        is confusing. This could be where the description contains the payee,
                                        reference, date, address, etc., or where the payee is completely blank.</p>
                                    <p class="pb-2">SmartMatch needs a certain amount of previous reconciliation data to
                                        train
                                        with–around 100 matches in our testing. Accuracy will be higher with more
                                        examples but Otto is trained to skip reconciliations he is not sure of so
                                        you should not see incorrect reconciliations.</p>
                                    <p><b>We are constantly working to improve how accurate Otto's work is and you will
                                        automatically benefit from these improvements.</b></p>

                                    <p class="pb-2">GuidedMatch lets you tell Otto to reconcile something when he isn't
                                        confident enough to do that himself.</p>
                                    <p class="pb-2">When you tell Otto he should have matched a transaction he didn't
                                        reconcile, he will see your feedback the next day and reconcile that
                                        transaction. There's no cost for GuidedMatch so you give Otto the feedback he
                                        needs to constantly improve <i>and</i> you don't have to go into Xero to
                                        reconcile the transaction. Win-win!</p>
                                    <p class="pb-2">GuidedMatch is separate to the monthly training, so Otto isn't
                                        learning what you have told him at this point&endash;he just trusts your
                                        decision and follow it.</p>
                                </div>

                                        he need to be trained?</h3>
                                    <p class="pb-2">He doesn't. He will reconcile any bank rules you have set up, from
                                        day one. You just need to make sure that the rules only match what you want them
                                        to, and that they don't require any information to be entered during the
                                        reconciliation.</p>
                                    <p class="pb-2">SmartMatch works using information about previous reconciliations so you
                                        don't need to do anything there–we take care of it all.</p>
                                    <p class="pb-2"><b>However</b>, giving feedback in the portal is a key part of
                                        making sure Otto understands what should and should not be reconciled so we
                                        recommend you spend a little bit of time each week letting him know how accurate
                                        his decisions have been so he will improve next time he is retrained.</p>

                                        Otto just reconcile any green match he sees?</h3>
                                    <p>Absolutely not. We're about matching the correct transactions, and
                                        avoiding mistakes, not clicking the OK button as many times as possible.
                                        We would rather skip some possible matches than match something
                                        incorrectly.</p>

                                        <li><b>Bank transfers</b> These are a little more complicated than bills

                                        such as bank account fees, payment processing fees, and transfers. They are also
                                        helpful where the sales invoice or receipt has been generated outside of
                                        Xero, for platforms like Stripe. For companies with payroll, rules can
                                        normally be created for the wage payment, PAYE, and pension payments.</p>
