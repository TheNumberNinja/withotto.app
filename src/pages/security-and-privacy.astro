                                ensure that your data, and that of your clients, is safe. This guide explains some of those steps
                                and can also be shared with your clients so they know their data is in good hands.</p>

                                Each practice has its own Otto, who only works within that practice. Data is not shared
                                between practices.

                                <b>You have full control over access to clients</b><br>
                                As with any other member of your team, Otto’s access to clients is managed through your Xero
                                HQ account. Otto can only access a client if he has been given access. You can add and
                                remove access to your clients at any time.
                            </p>

                                Otto accesses Xero via a browser and logs in just like you do. His password is randomly
                                generated and consists of a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 2FA is
                                also enabled. His login details are securely stored and encrypted.
                            </p>

                                We recommend providing Otto with a Xero role that offers the minimum access possible. This
                                is Standard for regular Xero business plans, and Managed Client for partner-only plans such as
                                Ledger and Cashbook.
